=================================================== CLEAN ARCHITECTURE ===================================================

It is a software architecture pattern proposed by Robert C. Martin that aims to create well-structured,
highly testable, and easily maintainable software systems, focusing on the separation of responsibilities
and the creation of independent layers, allowing the code to be more flexible and adaptable to changes.

Officially it is divided into circles:

- APPLICATION acts as a bridge between the domain layer and the external interfaces of the application.

NOTE: Infrastructure and Persistence can both be considered Infrastructure...
NOTE: The separation is not super rigid, it varies from scenario to scenario, but this is the foundation.

    Presentation (Interface Adapters):
        - Web Pages
        - Web Components
        - Web APIs
        - Controllers
        - Views
        - Filters
        - Attributes
        - View Models
        - Style Sheets
        - JavaScript

    Infrastructure (Frameworks & Drivers):
        - Auth and Identity
        - File and Object Storage
        - Message Queue Storage
        - Services
        - Email/Notification Services
        - Logging Services
        - Payment Services
        - Social Logins

    Persistence (Frameworks & Drivers):
        - Data Context
        - Repositories
        - Data Migrations
        - Data Seeding
        - In-Memory Caching
        - Cache
}
middle circle {
    Application (Use cases):
        - Abstractions
        - Contracts
        - Ports
        - Business Services
        - Commands and Queries
        - Application Exceptions
        - DTOs
        - Request and Response Models
        - Mapping DTOs
        - Validators
        - Behaviors
        - Specifications
        - Persistence Interfaces
}    
inner circle {
    Domain:
        - Domain Entities
        - Aggregates
        - Value Objects
        - Domain Events
        - Enumerations
        - Constants
        - Rule Interfaces
        - Domain Exceptions
}

There is a clear concept regarding dependencies:
- It goes from outside to inside.
- Nothing in the inner circle knows about the outer circle, but the outer circle knows about the inner one.
*Analyze the project dependencies for better understanding*
    - Domain has no dependencies.
    - Application depends on Domain.
    - Persistence depends on Application.
    - API depends on Application and Persistence (only at runtime).
