=================================================== CQRS ===================================================
*Recommended for complex projects with high scalability*
*Some scenarios choose to separate databases, I prefer a single database with different contexts*

The CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern separates read operations (queries) from write
operations (commands) in a system. This means that actions that change the system state (such as creating,
updating, or deleting data) are handled separately from actions that only query the system state.

This separation of responsibilities allows each path to be optimized independently to meet specific needs,
maximizing performance, scalability, and security.

Most important points of CQRS:

1- Separation of responsibilities:
    - Separates reads and writes into different models, using commands to update data and queries to read data.
    
2- Uses distinct domain models:
    - You can create different domain models for read operations and write operations.

3- Encourages scalability:
    - Facilitates scalability, since read and write operations can be scaled independently of each other.

4- Access control and security:
    - Allows more granular control over data security and access.

5- Encourages flexibility:
    - With CQRS, you can choose the most appropriate technologies and strategies to handle commands and queries.
