=================================================== Commands ===================================================

A command is a simple class that represents a request to modify the state of the system and contains
information about the action to be executed, such as the parameters required to perform the operation.

    - The command class (Command) should not contain business logic; its role is to transport data.

A command Handler is a class that processes a specific command and contains the business logic associated
with the execution of the command.
    
    - The handler class is responsible for receiving the command, validating its data, executing the appropriate
      action in the domain, and optionally updating the state of the system.
