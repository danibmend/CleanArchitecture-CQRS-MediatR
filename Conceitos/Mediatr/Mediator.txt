- MEDIATOR: PATTERN
- MEDIATR: Package that allows working with CQRS using the Mediator pattern.

The Mediator Pattern deals with decoupling by placing an intermediate layer between components, called
the "Mediator," which becomes their single source of dependencies.

Implementation scheme using MEDIATR:

API -> Controller -> Query/Command -> Mediator -> QueryHandler/CommandHandler -> DataStore
