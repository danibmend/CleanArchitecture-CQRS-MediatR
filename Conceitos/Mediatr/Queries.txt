=================================================== Queries ===================================================

A Query represents a request to read data from the system without modifying its state.

    - It is a class that contains the parameters and necessary information for the query and does not
      contain business logic; its main purpose is to transport input data for the query.

A QueryHandler is a class used to process a specific query and contains the logic to retrieve data
from the system based on the query.

    - It receives the query as input, executes the query against the database or other data sources,
      transforms the data into a view model (Response), and returns the result.
