=================================================== BEHAVIOR ===================================================

Behavior is a feature that allows adding common logic to all or some request handlers in the
implementation of CQRS with MediatR.

    - It is used to encapsulate functionalities that must be executed before or after the processing
      of a request.

Pipeline Behavior is used to add processing logic before and after a request handler and allows
adding global behaviors to all requests or to a specific subset of them.

Notification Handlers are used to react to system event notifications, executing specific actions
when those events occur.
