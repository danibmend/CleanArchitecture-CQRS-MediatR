=================================================== POSSIBILITIES ===================================================

Since I used the concepts of CQRS and mediator together with the MediatR library in a simple way, some possible objects
were left out.

==================================================== QUICK REFERENCE =====================================================
DTOS -> APPLICATION.
OPTIONS -> INFRASTRUCTURE.
EXTENSIONS -> INFRASTRUCTURE.
PROVIDERS -> INFRASTRUCTURE.
IPROVIDERS -> APPLICATION (Provider interfaces).
AUTHHANDLER + REQUIREMENT -> PRESENTATION.
FILES -> INFRASTRUCTURE.
MIDDLEWARE (EXCEPTION/AUTH/OTHER) -> PRESENTATION.

EXCEPTIONS should be evaluated according to their purpose
    - Business exceptions -> DOMAIN
    - Exceptions for invalid flow, not found, conflict -> APPLICATION
    - Exceptions for DB errors, external API errors -> INFRASTRUCTURE

CONSTANTS should be evaluated according to their purpose
    - Validation error messages -> APPLICATION
    - Business rule violation messages -> DOMAIN
    - Business/domain concepts -> DOMAIN
    - API text -> PRESENTATION

ENUMS should be evaluated according to their purpose
    - Status/Indicator (database) -> DOMAIN
    - Flow -> APPLICATION

FACTORIES should be evaluated according to their purpose
    - Normally interfaces and implementation -> APPLICATION
    - ExternalService Factory (Email) -> Interface (APPLICATION) / Implementation (INFRASTRUCTURE)


==================================================== ORGANIZED ====================================================

DOMAIN:
    - Business exceptions
    - Constant for business rule violation messages
    - Constant for business/domain concepts
    - Enum for Status/Indicator (database)

APPLICATION:
    - DTOs
    - Exceptions for invalid flow, not found, conflict
    - Constant for validation error messages
    - Enum for flow
    - Factories: always interfaces and usually implementation

INFRASTRUCTURE:
    - Options
    - Extensions
    - Files
    - Exceptions for DB errors, external API errors
    - Factories for external services (IMPLEMENTATION ONLY)

PRESENTATION:
    - Middlewares (Exception/Auth)
    - Auth Handler + Requirement
    - Constant for API text
    - Providers that depend on HttpContext, Claim, Request...
    - Extensions for HttpContext, Claim, Request...
